Trayscale

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/deedles.dev/trayscale)](https://goreportcard.com/report/deedles.dev/trayscale)

Trayscale is an unofficial GUI wrapper around the Tailscale CLI client, particularly for use on Linux, as no official Linux GUI client exists. Despite the name, it does _not_ provide a tray icon, as support for them has been removed in Gtk4. If support can ever be brought back, however, a tray icon would be nice.
